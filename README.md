"Never odd or even" is a location-based game that promotes real world exploration.  
Initially, the world is devoid of colour. Within the setting of the game, the player's mission is to visit fictional "broadcasting centres" in real world locations.  
The aim of the game is to infiltrate and hack these centres in the form of a mini-game. Once all centres are completed, the colour is completely restored in the world.

This app uses:
* Google Maps API
* Core Graphics and Core Animations using UIBezierPaths (included in standard libraries)
  
This app is also optimised for iPhone 7, though should be compatible with other screen resolutions.  
  
**Important!** This app needs to be run in debug mode, where the "City Run" mode is selected to spoof the location. We have placed "points of interest" along the city run route that demonstrate the functionality of the app. When demonstrating on a real device, these points of interest need to be changed programmatically to reflect the real location.
