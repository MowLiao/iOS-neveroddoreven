--------------------------  
"Never odd or even" is a location-based game that promotes real world exploration.  
Initially, the world is devoid of colour. Within the setting of the game, the player's mission is to visit fictional "broadcasting centres" in real world locations.  
The aim of the game is to infiltrate and hack these centres in the form of a mini-game. Once all centres are completed, the colour is completely restored in the world.
